<h3>Car themed Fake API</h3>

<p align="justify">Repository stores .NET Core 3.1 Web API training solution in theme "Authorized Car Service"(ordering parts from dealers, servicing history, cars, drivers, mechanics and dealers database etc.) mainly to meet: CQRS design pattern; way to implement pagination; MediatR. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Elfocrash">Nick Chapsas</a> for his great explanations on these things(check his youtube too <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ElfocrashDev">here</a>). Only 2 from 6 models are implemented so if someone wants to try for themselves, go ahead. API can also be used to exercise with frontend implementation. Validation from FV relies on <code>ValidationException</code> throwing which I don't like but didn't resolve problem with <code>TResponse</code> combined in some result class for <code>ValidationBehaviour</code> using IPipelineBehavior :{</p>
